  abstract = {Objectives: Implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding system presents challenges for using administrative data. Recognizing this, we conducted a multistep process to develop ICD-10 coding algorithms to define Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities in administrative data and assess the performance of the resulting algorithms. Methods: ICD-10 coding algorithms were developed by "translation" of the ICD-9-CM codes constituting Deyo's (for Charlson comorbidities) and Elixhauser's coding algorithms and by physicians' assessment of the face-validity of selected ICD-10 codes. The process of carefully developing ICD-10 algorithms also produced modified and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities. We then used data on in-patients aged 18 years and older in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 administrative hospital discharge data from a Canadian health region to assess the comorbidity frequencies and mortality prediction achieved by the original ICD-9-CM algorithms, the enhanced ICD-9-CM algorithms, and the new ICD-10 coding algorithms. Results: Among 56,585 patients in the ICD-9-CM data and 58,805 patients in the ICD-10 data, frequencies of the 17 Charlson comorbidities and the 30 Elixhauser comorbidities remained generally similar across algorithms. The new ICD-10 and enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithms either matched or outperformed the original Deyo and Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithms in predicting in-hospital mortality. The C-statistic was 0.842 for Deyo's ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.860 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm, and 0.859 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.868 for the original Elixhauser ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, 0.870 for the ICD-10 coding algorithm and 0.878 for the enhanced ICD-9-CM coding algorithm. Conclusions: These newly developed ICD-10 and ICD-9-CM comorbidity coding algorithms produce similar estimates of comorbidity prevalence in administrative data, and may outperform existing ICD-9-CM coding algorithms.},

  abstract = {Objectives. This study attempts to develop a comprehensive set of comorbidity measures for use with large administrative inpatient datasets., Methods. The study involved clinical and empirical review of comorbidity measures, development of a framework that attempts to segregate comorbidities from other aspects of the patient's condition, development of a comorbidity algorithm, and testing on heterogeneous and homogeneous patient groups. Data were drawn from all adult, nonmaternal inpatients from 438 acute care hospitals in California in 1992 (n = 1,779,167). Outcome measures were those commonly available in administrative data: length of stay, hospital charges, and in-hospital death., Results. A comprehensive set of 30 comorbidity measures was developed. The comorbidities were associated with substantial increases in length of stay, hospital charges, and mortality both for heterogeneous and homogeneous disease groups. Several comorbidities are described that are important predictors of outcomes, yet commonly are not measured. These include mental disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, obesity, coagulopathy, weight loss, and fluid and electrolyte disorders., Conclusions. The comorbidities had independent effects on outcomes and probably should not be simplified as an index because they affect outcomes differently among different patient groups. The present method addresses some of the limitations of previous measures. It is based on a comprehensive approach to identifying comorbidities and separates them from the primary reason for hospitalization, resulting in an expanded set of comorbidities that easily is applied without further refinement to administrative data for a wide range of diseases., (C) Lippincott-Raven Publishers},

  abstract = {Eigen is versatile.
        It supports all matrix sizes, from small fixed-size matrices to arbitrarily large dense matrices, and even sparse matrices.
        It supports all standard numeric types, including std::complex, integers, and is easily extensible to custom numeric types.
        It supports various matrix decompositions and geometry features.
        Its ecosystem of unsupported modules provides many specialized features such as non-linear optimization, matrix functions, a polynomial solver, FFT, and much more.
    Eigen is fast.
        Expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries and enable lazy evaluation, when that is appropriate.
        Explicit vectorization is performed for SSE 2/3/4, AVX, FMA, AVX512, ARM NEON (32-bit and 64-bit), PowerPC AltiVec/VSX (32-bit and 64-bit) instruction sets, and now S390x SIMD (ZVector) with graceful fallback to non-vectorized code.
        Fixed-size matrices are fully optimized: dynamic memory allocation is avoided, and the loops are unrolled when that makes sense.
        For large matrices, special attention is paid to cache-friendliness.
    Eigen is reliable.
        Algorithms are carefully selected for reliability. Reliability trade-offs are clearly documented and extremely safe decompositions are available.
        Eigen is thoroughly tested through its own test suite (over 500 executables), the standard BLAS test suite, and parts of the LAPACK test suite.
    Eigen is elegant.
        The API is extremely clean and expressive while feeling natural to C++ programmers, thanks to expression templates.
        Implementing an algorithm on top of Eigen feels like just copying pseudocode.
    Eigen has good compiler support as we run our test suite against many compilers to guarantee reliability and work around any compiler bugs. Eigen also is standard C++98 and maintains very reasonable compilation times.},

  doi = {10.1097/MLR.0b013e31819432e5},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comorbidity measures are necessary to describe patient populations and adjust for confounding. In direct comparisons, studies have found the Elixhauser comorbidity system to be statistically slightly superior to the Charlson comorbidity system at adjusting for comorbidity. However, the Elixhauser classification system requires 30 binary variables, making its use for reporting and analysis of comorbidity cumbersome.
OBJECTIVE: Modify the Elixhauser classification system into a single numeric score for administrative data.
METHODS: For all hospitalizations at the Ottawa Hospital, Canada, between 1996 and 2008, we determined if International Classification of Disease codes for chronic diagnoses were in any of the 30 Elixhauser comorbidity groups. We then used backward stepwise multivariate logistic regression to determine the independent association of each comorbidity group with death in hospital. Regression coefficients were modified into a scoring system that reflected the strength of each comorbidity group's independent association with hospital death.
RESULTS: Hospitalizations that were included were 345,795 (derivation: 228,565; validation 117,230). Twenty-one of the 30 groups were independently associated with hospital mortality. The resulting comorbidity score had an equivalent discrimination in the derivation and validation groups (overall c-statistic 0.763, 95\% CI: 0.759-0.766). This was similar to models having all Elixhauser groups (0.760, 95\% CI: 0.756-0.764) or significant groups only (0.759, 95\% CI: 0.754-0.762), but significantly exceeded discrimination when comorbidity was expressed using the Charlson score (0.745, 95\% CI: 0.742-0.749).
CONCLUSION: When analyzing administrative data, the Elixhauser comorbidity system can be condensed to a single numeric score that summarizes disease burden and is adequately discriminative for death in hospital.},
