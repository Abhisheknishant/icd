#' @param icd_name The name of the column in the \code{data.frame} which
#'   contains the ICD codes. This is a character vector of length one. If it is
#'   \code{NULL}, \code{icd9} will attempt to guess the column name, looking for
#'   progressively less likely possibilities until it matches a single column.
#'   Failing this, it will take the first column in the data frame. Specifying
#'   the column using this argument avoids the guesswork.
